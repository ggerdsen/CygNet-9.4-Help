        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <p>The following FAQs may answer additional questions you might have about CygNet and ESE. </p>
        <h3>Do ESE-based datastores have size limitations? </h3>
        <p class="Indent">An ESE-based datastore can be used in an application that never has more than 1 megabyte (MB) of data; conversely, it can contain up to 2^32 pages of 4 KB sized pages or 16 TB of data. Be aware that this doesn’t mean that CygNet supports databases up to 16 TB; it just means that ESE is capable of databases of this size. Other factors to consider with database size include hard disk capacity, backup, restoration, defragmentation, and other database maintenance operations. </p>
        <h3>How does this change affect replication? </h3>
        <p class="Indent">It does not affect replication. In fact, you can replicate from a non-ESE-based datastore to an ESE-based datastore or vice-versa. See <a href="../Replication/Replication.htm">Replication</a> for more information.</p>
        <h3>Can I use an older version client with an ESE-based datastore? </h3>
        <p class="Indent">Yes. </p>
        <h3>How does a shut down get flagged as dirty (abnormal)? </h3>
        <p class="Indent">When a database is shut down before it has performed required maintenance, it is put into an inconsistent state. This kind of shutdown is flagged as a dirty shutdown. This term means that some transaction log files must be replayed before the database can be considered consistent. You cannot mount a database that was shut down in this state until the transaction logs have been replayed and the database has correctly detached from the current log stream. </p>
        <p class="Indent">ESE caches the disk by swapping 8 KB pages of data in and out of memory. It updates the pages in memory and then writes updated pages back to the disk. A page that has been written with data and is still being held in memory is called a <i>dirty</i> page. When there is a dirty page in memory, the database is flagged as being in an <i>inconsistent</i> state. A database is only in a <i>consistent</i> state when pages are successfully transferred to disk during a shutdown in which no errors occur. </p>
        <h3>ESE has rollback. What does that mean?</h3>
        <p class="Indent">Rollback is specific to the atomic nature of a transaction. When the service restarts after an abnormal shutdown, any transactions that are uncommitted are rolled back (removed) from the database. (A "version store" tracks and manages transactions.) </p>
