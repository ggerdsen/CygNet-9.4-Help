        <h3><a name="Aggregat"></a>Aggregation from Children</h3>
        <p>Aggregation from Children is one of several value assignment types that can be selected to determine how a meter or meter group receives its forecasted values.</p>
        <p>If a meter group is not directly forecasting its own forecast value, it can be assigned a value based on an aggregation of the forecasts of its child meters. This may be useful in displaying a forecast value for a logical grouping that does not have any meaningful associated input data, and thus no calculated forecast. An aggregation that is representative of child meter or meter groups may be useful for reporting purposes.</p>
        <p>Group aggregation is made in the form of an arithmetic expression. The operands of the expression can be a constant value or a meter or meter group facility tags. In the case of a facility tag, the net forecast value for the meter or meter group is substituted. Any meter or meter group facility tags contained in the expression must be child facilities of the target group.</p>
        <p>Grouping and aggregation are methods that can be used to create a multi-directional meter representation. For example, a group can be created with a receipt and delivery meter as children, and an aggregation can be setup for the group that subtracts the receipt meter’s forecast from the delivery meter’s forecast.</p>
        <p>See <a href="Configuring Aggregation From Children.htm">Configuring Aggregation From Children</a> for more information.</p>
        <h3><a name="Alpha"></a>Alpha Value</h3>
        <p>Also called the “momentum parameter,” this decimal value is used during the back-propagation step of the training algorithm to help minimize the negative impact of outlying training input data. The value should be between 0.0 and 1.0 exclusive.  Using an Alpha value close to 1.0 allows the <a href="#Neural_Network" class="selected">neural network</a> to make reasonably large weight adjustments as long as the corrections are in the same general direction for several patterns, while using a small learning rate to prevent a large response to the error from any one training pattern.</p>
        <p>See <a href="Configuring Tuning Parameters.htm">Configuring Tuning Parameters</a> for more information.</p>
        <h3><a name="Assignme"></a>Assignment from Parent</h3>
        <p>Assignment from Parent is one of several value assignment types that can be selected to determine how a meter or meter group receives its forecasted values.</p>
        <p>A child meter or meter group can be allocated a gas load forecast value from its parent meter instead of directly forecasting its own value. In some situations it might be more useful to perform forecasting at a group level, and then assign forecast values down to child meters. </p>
        <p>To assign a forecast value to a child meter from a parent meter group, assignment can be set using one of two assignment methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Assign Fixed Quantity, which allocates a percentage of the net forecast, or a fixed amount and a percentage of the net forecast for each child meter or group.</li>
            <li value="2">Balance from Historical Profile, which defines a historical profile offset that assigns a balanced proportion of the net forecast to selected multiple child meters to determine the relation between the flows of multiple child meters.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>See <a href="Configuring Assignment From Parent.htm">Configuring Assignment From Parent</a> for more information.</p><a href="#top" class="selected"><img src="../../Resources/Images/Shared Images/Arrow_top.png" style="float: right;padding-top: 6px;padding-right: 2px;padding-bottom: 2px;" title="Back to top" alt="Back to top" /></a>
        <h3><a name="Balancin"></a>Balancing Redistribution</h3>
        <p>Balancing Redistribution is one of several value assignment types that can be selected to determine how a meter or meter group receives its forecasted values.</p>
        <p>Use Balancing Redistribution to conditionally distribute a calculated forecast value for a group of meters based on whether the difference of two summed sets of meters is positive or negative. The two sets of meters represent a <b>Sum of Receipts</b> ( <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;">S</span>&#160;<span style="vertical-align: sub;">Receipts</span></span> ) and a <b>Sum of Deliveries</b> ( <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;">S</span>&#160;<span style="vertical-align: sub;">Deliveries</span></span> ). For example, this method of redistribution can assist you to make decisions about moving gas to and from storage as needed, or balancing gas receipts and deliveries across a pipeline.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">For a <b>Positive Value Distribution</b>, if the 
		<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;">S</span>&#160;<span style="vertical-align: sub;">Receipts</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-family: Symbol;">S</span>&#160;<span style="vertical-align: sub;">Deliveries</span>&#160;&#160;&gt;&#160;&#160;0</span>&#160;&#160;(is positive), the aggregated forecast value for a group of meters will be distributed to the configured set of child meters.</li>
            <li value="2">For a <b>Negative Value Distribution</b>, if the 
		<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;">S</span>&#160;<span style="vertical-align: sub;">Receipts</span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="font-family: Symbol;">S</span>&#160;<span style="vertical-align: sub;">Deliveries</span>&#160;&#160;&lt;&#160;&#160;0</span>&#160;&#160;(is negative), the aggregated forecast value for a group of meters will be distributed to a different configured set of child meters.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The distribution supports both a configured percentage assignment value (<b>Fixed Quantity Assignment</b> method) and a historical time offset forecast profile method (<b>Balance from Historical Profile Assignment</b> method). Redistributions can be configured to occur at various points during the energy load forecasting process: after all direct forecasting, after all assignments from parent groups, or after all group aggregation.  </p>
        <p>See <a href="Configuring Balancing Redistribution.htm">Configuring Balancing Redistribution</a> for more information.</p>
        <h3><a name="Categori"></a>Categorical Input Item Type</h3>
        <p>Categorical input item types must be accompanied by a table of allowable values that are valid values for a data item. Categorical data values have a list of allowable values specified for each defined input data item type. The allowable values must be 16 characters or less and will be stored in “String Input” Point Data Type points. </p>
        <p>See <a href="Configuring Input Data Items Import.htm">Configuring Input Data Items</a> for more information.</p>
        <h3><a name="Direct"></a>Direct Forecast</h3>
        <p>Direct Forecast is one of several value assignment types that can be selected to determine how a meter or meter group receives its forecasted values.</p>
        <p>Direct forecast is the process by which a meter or meter group’s gross forecast value is generated by a neural network. Once the input data has been retrieved and manipulated as described above, the normalized inputs are fed into the associated neural network engine. The resulting output of the calculation will be the gross forecast value.</p>
        <p>See <a href="Configuring Meter Meter Group Assignments Settings.htm">Configuring Meter/Meter Group Assignment Settings</a> for more information.</p><a href="#top" class="selected"><img src="../../Resources/Images/Shared Images/Arrow_top.png" style="float: right;padding-top: 6px;padding-right: 2px;padding-bottom: 2px;" title="Back to top" alt="Back to top" /></a>
        <h3><a name="Energy"></a>Energy Content</h3>
        <p>The energy content factor value used to convert a meter or meter group’s defined units to and from valid Energy and Volume units for the historical and forecast gas load input data. This value can be specified in the import file for meter and meter group entities, or configured manually. If the units are not provided, recognized or cannot be converted, the imported values will be rejected. If not included for an hour, the meter or meter group will use the default energy content. </p>
        <p>See <a href="Configuring System Settings.htm#System_Defaults">Configuring System Settings</a> and <a href="XML EnergyContent.htm">Energy Content</a> for more information.</p>
        <h3><a name="Epochs"></a>Epoch</h3>
        <p>The  training iterations allowed in the training session for the <a href="#Neural_Network" class="selected">neural network</a>. One epoch is all hours for all inputs. If the <a href="#Target_Tolerance" class="selected">Target Tolerance</a> was not achieved for a particular training cycle, consider raising the target tolerance or increasing the number of maximum epochs.</p>
        <p>See <a href="Configuring Tuning Parameters.htm">Configuring Tuning Parameters</a> and <a href="Viewing Training Results.htm">View Training Results</a> for more information.</p>
        <h3><a name="Expressi"></a>Expression Redistribution</h3>
        <p>Expression Redistribution is one of several value assignment types that can be selected to determine how a meter or meter group receives its forecasted values. </p>
        <p>Expression redistribution allows a single meter or meter group to retrieve its gross energy load forecast value from another meter or meter group’s net forecast value. For example, this can be useful when a newly created meter is not ready to have an associated trained neural network. For the time being, it can receive a forecast value from a meter in a similar weather location. Expression redistribution configuration takes the form of an arithmetic expression.</p>
        <p>Redistributions can be configured to occur at various points during the energy load forecasting process: after all direct forecasting, after all assignments from parent groups, or after all group aggregation. </p>
        <p>See <a href="Configuring Expression Redistribution.htm">Configuring Expression Redistribution</a> for more information.</p>
        <h3><a name="External"></a>External ID</h3>
        <p>The ID of the unique external ID value provided in the import file that links to a meter or meter group facility record.</p>
        <p>See <a href="Configuring Meter Meter Group General Settings.htm">Configuring Meter/Meter Group General Settings</a> and <a href="XML Meter.htm">Meter</a> for more information.</p>
        <h3><a name="Filling"></a>Filling Rules</h3>
        <p>Before training occurs, the data that is designated as inputs to the training process must be filled if necessary. As each hour is imported into the system, filling rules are applied first, followed by <a href="#Validati" class="selected">validation rules</a>.</p>
        <p>Data filling settings must be associated with a particular <a href="#Input_Item_Type" class="selected">Input Item Type</a> (<a href="#Ordinal" class="selected">Ordinal</a> or <a href="#Categori" class="selected">Categorical</a>). If provided, the Input data filling parameters will be used to fill in the entry for an hourly interval when the hourly interval is missing from the import file. Missing hours will be filled with a placeholder with no value by the import process.</p>
        <p>The import process detects missing hours by using the defined beginning and ending range in the import file. The adding of placeholder values during the import ensures a continuous stream of hourly data for the import data range. However, it is possible that training time ranges may specify a broader range for which there may be missing input data. Data filling will also occur for any additional missing hours that are specified in the training input ranges.</p>
        <p>Values that are filled will be modified in the VHS. To indicate that the value was edited due to data filling, the ELF driver will flag a user bit on the stored entry for the hour.</p>
        <p>The data filling methods for Ordinal input item types are No Action, Default Value, Previous Value, and Linear Fill. The data validation methods for Categorical input item types are No Action, Default Value, and Previous Value.</p>

        <h3><a name="Forecast"></a>Forecast Override</h3>
        <p>It is possible to override forecasted hourly values with externally provided forecast values, so that the best gas load values for meters or meter groups with a known gas load schedule are used as the forecast. Two override sources are supported (primary and secondary), one each for Energy and Volume values, to allow a staged override of forecast values. </p>
        <p>A forecast value can be prioritized and configured to indicate the amount of time to override with the lower priority source (secondary), after the higher priority source (primary) has been used for a specified amount of time.</p>

        <h3><a name="Forecast2"></a>Forecasting</h3>
        <p>The Energy Load Forecasting process utilizes a trained neural network definition to generate energy load forecast values for its associated meter or meter group. A forecasting task is completed as an entire body of work for all effective neural network definitions.</p>
        <p>See <a href="Energy Load Forecasting.htm">Energy Load Forecasting</a> for more information.</p><a href="#top" class="selected"><img src="../../Resources/Images/Shared Images/Arrow_top.png" style="float: right;padding-top: 6px;padding-right: 2px;padding-bottom: 2px;" title="Back to top" alt="Back to top" /></a>
        <h3><a name="Gas2"></a>Gas Load Data - Historical and Forecast</h3>
        <p>In order to forecast  you must import historical and/or forecast gas load data into the system, which the ELF system uses to generate energy load forecast values for an associated meter or meter group. </p>
        <p>See <a href="Understanding the CygNet ELF Import Schema.htm">Understanding the CygNet ELF Import Schema</a> for more information about preparing the gas load data import files.</p>
        <h3><a name="Gas"></a>Gas Load Type</h3>
        <p>For all gas load values imported or generated by the system, the gas load type indicates if the values will be stored in points configured in Energy units, Volume units or Both in two separate points; one with Energy units, one with Volume units for meter and meter group facilities.</p>

        <h3><a name="Import"></a>Import Folders</h3>
        <p>The mechanism for importing external input data for forecasting is via an XML file, which must be placed in an import folder accessible to the ELF system. There are four ELF file import types: historical gas load data, forecast gas load data, historical input data, and forecasted input data and there are there three types of folders:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">the folder from where the import file will be read (Source)</li>
            <li value="2">the folder to which the import file will be written while it is being processed (Processing)</li>
            <li value="3">the folder to which the processed import file will be written once processing is completed (Processed).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a name="Input_Data"></a>Input Data - Historical and Forecast</h3>
        <p>In order to forecast  you must import historical and/or forecast input data into the system, which the ELF system uses to generate energy load forecast values for an associated meter or meter group. </p>
        <p>See <a href="Understanding the CygNet ELF Import Schema.htm">Understanding the CygNet ELF Import Schema</a> for more information about preparing the input data import files.</p>
        <h3><a name="Input_Item"></a>Input Item</h3>
        <p>External historical input data and forecasted input data must be imported into the ELF system in order to train a neural network and generate energy load forecast values for an associated meter or meter group. These are known as Input Items.</p>
        <p>Examples of Input Items are weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, heating degree day, cooling degree day, etc)and calendar items (time of day, day of week/month/year). An example of a non-weather Input Item would be an economic factor.</p>
        <p>See <a href="Configuring Input Items.htm">Configuring Input Items</a> for more information.</p>
        <h3><a name="Input_Item_Category"></a>Input Item Category</h3>
        <p>Input items are further organized by category. An example of an Input Item Category might be Weather.</p>
        <p>See <a href="Configuring Input Items.htm">Configuring Input Items</a> for more information.</p>
        <h3><a name="Input_Item_Type"></a>Input Item Type</h3>
        <p>Input items categories are further organized by type. There are two types of input items: <a href="#Ordinal" class="selected">Ordinal</a> and <a href="#Categori" class="selected">Categorical</a></p>
        <p>See <a href="Configuring Input Items.htm">Configuring Input Items</a> for more information.</p>
        <h3><a name="Input_Owner"></a>Input Owner/Input Owner Group</h3>
        <p>The terms “Input Owner” and “Record Owner”  refer to an entity or facility that “owns” a set of input data for a given period. For example, several hours of weather input data may belong to (be owned by) the same regional weather station. The input record owner entities are specified in the import file or entered manually, and are represented as facilities in the configured CygNet FAC service. Facility type attributes are used to store associated parent and child relationships between Record Owners and Record Owner Groups. </p>
        <p>The terms “Input Owner”and “Record Owner”   are used interchangeably throughout the ELF system and in this documentation.</p>
        <p>See <a href="Configuring Input Items.htm">Configuring Input Items</a>, <a href="XML RecordOwners.htm">Record Owners</a>, and <a href="XML RecordOwner.htm">Record Owner</a> for more information.</p><a href="#top" class="selected"><img src="../../Resources/Images/Shared Images/Arrow_top.png" style="float: right;padding-top: 6px;padding-right: 2px;padding-bottom: 2px;" title="Back to top" alt="Back to top" /></a>
        <h3><a name="Lag"></a>Lag Effect</h3>
        <p>A "lag effect" is a time offset, into the past, from which to read input data values. For example, an input data item of "ambient temperature" may be specified as input to a neural network definition causing its historical values to be used for neural network training and its forecast values to be used for forecasting. However, the ability to add an additional input data item, also associated with "ambient temperature" values but given a lag effect offset (7 days, for example), must also be provided. Providing a time lagged input value can provide significant improvements to the forecasting accuracy in the case when an input data item’s values have some correlation to what the value was in the recent past.</p>
        <p>See <a href="Configuring Input Data Items Neural Network.htm">Configuring Input Data Items</a> for more information.</p>
        <h3><a name="Learning"></a>Learning Rate</h3>
        <p>A decimal value (between 0.0 and 1.0 exclusive) used during the back-propagation step of the training algorithm to determine what fraction of the calculated error from each training pattern is applied as a correction to the weights of <a href="#Neural_Network" class="selected">neural network</a> being trained. A value close to 1.0 has the potential of converging to the <a href="#Target_Tolerance" class="selected">target tolerance</a> more quickly but also may result in an over-correction that causes the training process to fail to converge. Values between 0.1 and 0.2 are typical for yielding a successful training with a reasonable number of epochs.</p>
        <p>See <a href="Configuring Tuning Parameters.htm">Configuring Tuning Parameters</a> for more information.</p>
        <h3><a name="Meter_Meter Group"></a>Meter/Meter Group</h3>
        <p>The term "Meter" and "Meter Group" refer to the basic entity or node within the ELF system for which energy load forecast values are generated. The meter entities are specified in the import file or entered manually, and are represented as facilities in the configured CygNet FAC service. Facility type attributes are used to store associated parent and child relationships between Meters and Meter Groups. </p>
        <p>See <a href="Configuring Meters and Input Owners.htm">Configuring Meters and Input Owners</a>, <a href="XML Meters.htm">Meters</a>, <a href="XML Meter.htm">Meter</a> for more information.</p>
        <h3><a name="Meter_Hierarchy"></a>Meter Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>The ELF system allows for the configuration of up to 10 meter hierarchies, which are logical groupings of facilities for the purpose of forecast <a href="#Value_Assignment" class="selected">value assignment</a>. Examples of different meter hierarchies may include one for Navigation, one for Sales, one for Geographic Location. A single facility (meter or meter group) can have at most 10 parents and therefore be part of up to 10 distinct meter hierarchies. </p>
        <p>For example, multiple hierarchies may exist to allow for following circumstance: One meter hierarchy requires that  direct forecast values be rolled down from a parent and split up amongst its children. Then those forecast values of the children are aggregated and rolled up to a parent in a different meter hierarchy.</p>
        <p>Any  facility (meter or meter group) in the ELF system may <i>only</i> get its forecast values from one source.</p>
        <p>Hierarchy membership, parents, and children, and their related forecast assignment rules are configured on the <a href="Configuring Meter Meter Group Assignments Settings.htm">Meter/Groups Settings Assignments</a> dialog box.</p><a href="#top" class="selected"><img src="../../Resources/Images/Shared Images/Arrow_top.png" style="float: right;padding-top: 6px;padding-right: 2px;padding-bottom: 2px;" title="Back to top" alt="Back to top" /></a>
        <h3><a name="Neural_Network"></a>Neural Network</h3>
        <p>A forecasting technique used to model the very complex relationships between known causes such as weather and calendar and their affect on customer demand for natural gas. This forecasting technique is called “feed-forward, back-propagation neural networks” or “neural networks” for short. The Estimated Load Forecasting system uses neural networks to generate the estimated customer demand (gas load) for a natural gas pipeline.</p>
        <p>See <a href="#Neural_Network_Training" class="selected">neural network training</a> below.</p>
        <h3><a name="Neural_Network_Defn"></a>Neural Network Definition</h3>
        <p>The neural network definition contains the primary set of parameters required for configuring a neural network, including those that identify all input data required to both successfully train the neural network and forecast gas load estimates for a single meter or meter group</p>

        <h3><a name="Neural_Network_Training"></a>Neural Network Training</h3>
        <p>The process of training a neural network requires the configuration of the neural network to produce sufficiently accurate estimates into the future based upon forecasted input data. The training algorithm is such that the neural network "learns" the relationships between the known historical inputs and their affect on the known historical outputs allowing it to predict future outputs based upon reasonable forecasted values.</p>

        <h3><a name="Redistri"></a>Redistribution</h3>
        <p>Redistributions allow a meter or meter group to retrieve its gross forecast value from another meter or meter group’s net forecast value. For example, this can be useful when a newly created meter is not ready to have an associated trained neural network. For the time being, it can receive a forecast value from a meter in a similar weather location.</p>
        <p>The ELF system support two types of redistribution: by <a href="#Expressi" class="selected">expression</a> and <a href="#Balancin" class="selected">balancing</a>.</p>

        <h3><a name="Rollup"></a>Rollup Forecast</h3>
        <p>Rollup Forecast is one of several value assignment types that can be selected to determine how a meter or meter group receives its forecasted values.</p>
        <p>Rollup forecast is the process where a meter group's gross forecast values are assigned based on the rollup of the actual historical gas load values of the group's children.</p>

        <h3><a name="Validati"></a>Validation Rules</h3>
        <p>Before training occurs, the data that is designated as inputs to the training process must be validated. As each hour is imported into the system, <a href="#Filling" class="selected">filling rules</a> are applied first, followed by validation rules.</p>
        <p>Data validation settings must be associated with a particular <a href="#Input_Item_Type" class="selected">Input Item Type</a> (<a href="#Ordinal" class="selected">Ordinal</a> or <a href="#Categori" class="selected">Categorical</a>). If provided, the validation settings are used to check each input value. If a value does not comply with the validation settings, it will not be used for the corresponding hour interval. Instead, a value will be assigned for the hour based on the configured data filling settings.</p>
        <p>The data validation methods for Ordinal data item types are Out-of-Range Validation and Deviation Validation. The data validation methods for Categorical data item types are Data Generation, and Default Value.</p>
        <p>See <a href="Configuring Data Validation Rules.htm">Configuring Data Validation Rules</a> for more information.</p>
        <h3><a name="Value_Adjustment"></a>Value Adjustment</h3>
        <p>A value adjustment will occur whenever a meter or meter group’s gross point value is set by any of the defined <a href="#Value_Assignment" class="selected">Value Assignment</a> Type methods. The adjustment is applied to the gross forecast value immediately upon the gross value being assigned, and output to the meter or meter group’s net forecast point. This will ensure that all adjustments are completed before redistributions are processed. Three adjustment types are available:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">net forecast equals gross forecast (default setting) — Copy the gross forecast to the net forecast value.</li>
            <li value="2">net forecast equals a fixed linear equation — The two required parameters will be the numeric coefficients A and B in the linear formula: net = A * gross + B.</li>
            <li value="3">net forecast equals an overridden forecast value — It is possible to <a href="#Forecast" class="selected">override</a> forecasted hourly values with externally provided forecast values, so that the best gas load values for meters or meter groups with a known gas load schedule are used as the forecast. Two override sources are supported (primary and secondary), one each for Energy and Volume values, to allow for a staged override of forecast values. The override sources can be prioritized and configured to indicate the time interval to override with the lower priority source, after the higher priority source has been used for a specified time interval.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If no adjustments are currently active, the default action will be to copy the gross forecast to the net forecast value. The default adjustment rule will never expire, unless the end time is bounded.</p>

        <h3><a name="Variance2"></a>Variance Analysis</h3>
        <p>Variance analysis compares the actual historical values to the forecasted values so that <a href="#Neural_Network" class="selected">neural network</a> definitions that are not performing well can be identified and retrained with the assumption that future estimates will improve. The analysis process runs at a time that is after the forecasted time interval elapses and the actual output values become known. This allows the variance between estimated and actual output values to be determined. If the variance is too high, retrain the neural network with an improved set of historical input and output values.</p>
        <p>Variance analysis processing can add retraining tasks to the training priority queue for neural network definitions whose forecasts are not within an acceptable range of the actual energy load. The  process can be triggered on demand for all qualified neural network definitions by a direct user command or scheduled through the MSS.</p>
        <p>See <a href="Forecast Variance Analysis.htm">Forecast Variance Analysis</a> for more information.</p>
        <h3><a name="Variance"></a>Variance Threshold</h3>
        <p>The minimum calculated variance threshold that triggers the retraining of a <a href="#Neural_Network" class="selected">neural network</a> definition. For example, a value of 0.7 means that the forecast is 30% accurate. This value may be overridden at the meter or meter group facility.</p>

        <h3><a name="Weight"></a>Weight Assignment</h3>
        <p>Prior to training a <a href="#Neural_Network" class="selected">neural network</a>, the internal weights of the neural network must be initialized to random values. The weight assignment values allow some control over how the internal weights are assigned so that optimal settings may be determined and saved. The weight assignment can be either an arbitrary seed or a seed value.</p>
