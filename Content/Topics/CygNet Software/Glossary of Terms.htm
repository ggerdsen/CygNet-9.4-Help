        <h3>32-bit and 64-bit Components</h3>
        <p>The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the way a computer's processor  handles information. The 64-bit version of Windows handles large amounts of random access memory more effectively than a 32-bit system. </p>
        <p><span class="CygNetVariablesSoftwareName">CygNet Software</span> provides support for two 64-bit services (a 64-bit <b>Universal Interface Service (UIS)</b>, and a 64-bit <b>Value History Service (VHS)</b>) and all  <b>remote device drivers</b>, <b>communication device drivers</b>, and <b>import export drivers</b> are available in 64-bit versions, with the exception of the SonicMQ Export EIE and the SonicQ EIE, which are limited to 32-bit. Note that only the driver portion of each EIE is 64-bit; the associated editor is not 64-bit.</p>
        <p>For more information see <a href="../Services/Services Overview.htm#64-bit">Services Overview</a> and <a href="../Devices/64-bit Device Drivers.htm">64-bit Device Drivers</a>.</p>
        <h3><a name="A"></a><a name="Access"></a>Access Control Service (ACS)</h3>
        <p>The Access Control Service (ACS) is the <span class="CygNetVariablesSoftwareName">CygNet Software</span> security administration service. Its database contains the list of applications and events for which security is required, as well as the list of users and their authorization levels. In terms of security each service is an application. Security can also be applied at the record level in a service. The ACS can provide security for custom applications provided they can communicate with the ACS. It functions in concert with the operating system security (Microsoft Windows) to protect access to your system.</p>
        <p>For more information see <a href="../Security/Security.htm">Security</a>.</p>
        <h3><a name="Address"></a>Address Resolution Service (ARS)</h3>
        <p>The Address Resolution Service (ARS) is the <span class="CygNetVariablesSoftwareName">CygNet Software</span> directory service that  resolves network addresses. It is sometimes called a metadata service since it resolves information about other CygNet services. The ARS must be running in order to install <span class="CygNetVariablesSoftwareName">CygNet Software</span> successfully. It tracks the network address and operational status of each service within a CygNet domain.</p>
        <p>A service must be added to the ARS before it is started for the first time. This eliminates superfluous entries and enforces administrator security. You can view and modify ARS records using CygNet Explorer.</p>
        <p>For more information see <a href="../Address Resolution Service/Address Resolution Service.htm">Address Resolution</a>.</p>
        <h3>Admin.sec</h3>
        <p>Security Supervisors File. For more information see <a href="../Security/Security Supervisors.htm">Security Supervisors</a>.</p>
        <h3>AGA</h3>

        <h3><a name="Alarm_Cond"></a>Alarm Condition</h3>
        <p>Alarm condition is the same as point state, in that it is the highest precedented state for a point record as defined in the CvsMetadata file for the current point scheme, except that in the point state definition for each point state, the <i>alarm condition</i> attribute <u>must</u> be set to "true" for the alarm condition to be considered. When alarm condition is set to true, the defined point state is considered a valid alarm condition.</p>
        <p>For a system running the default CygNet Standard Point Scheme (Point Scheme 0), point state and alarm condition closely follow each other. For example, when a point is in a <i>High Alarm</i> condition, the point state and alarm condition will both be <i>High Alarm</i>.</p>
        <p>For the<b> CygNet standard point scheme</b>, three point state definitions do not allow alarm condition configuration: the <i>Normal</i>, <i>Unreliable</i>, and <i>Uninitialized</i> point states. For these three point state definitions, the alarm condition attribute is always "false," meaning that these point states will never be considered an alarm condition. So when a point is in a Normal, Unreliable, or Uninitialized state, the alarm condition will be blank.</p>
        <p>For all other point state definitions, alarm condition is the highest precedented point state when alarm condition is set to true. </p>
        <h4>CygNet Standard Point Scheme</h4>
        <p>The following table lists the point state definitions which allow an alarm condition for the standard point scheme:</p>

        <h3><a name="Audit"></a>Audit Service (AUD)</h3>
        <p>The Audit Service (AUD) tracks and stores all changes, such as what was changed, when it was changed, and the individual who made the change, known as the audit record. It logs operator actions and configuration changes, as defined for various services. The level of detail contained in an audit record is based on the service’s auditing configuration. The Audit Service does not audit itself.</p>
        <p>Auditable actions include starting or stopping a service through the RSM, updating or deleting values in the VHS, setpoint changes, point configuration changes, etc.</p>
        <p>For more information see <a href="../Auditing/Auditing.htm">Auditing</a>.</p>
        <h3><a name="Automatic"></a>Automatic Backups</h3>
        <p>Automatic full backups are user defined to a relative or absolute directory path, based on defined keyword parameters set in the applicable CygNet services’ configuration files. </p>
        <p>For more information see <a href="../Backup and Restore/Backup and Restore.htm">Backup and Restore</a>.</p>
        <h3>Automatic Service Recovery</h3>
        <p>The RSM is expected to restart (or fix) any failed local service. This is accomplished via the <a href="../Automatic Service Recovery/Automatic Service Recovery.htm">Automatic Service Recovery</a> feature of CygNet, configured for each service in the RSM. Whenever a service shuts down abnormally the RSM will attempt to restart the service via the recovery actions configured in the RSM. Automatic service recovery can be mass configured for all services in a Redundancy environment via the <a href="../Redundancy/Redundancy Editor - Automatic Service Recovery.htm">Automatic Service Recovery</a> option in the Redundancy Editor.</p><a href="#top" class="selected"><img src="../../Resources/Images/Shared Images/Arrow_top.png" style="float: right;padding-top: 6px;padding-right: 2px;padding-bottom: 2px;" title="Back to top" alt="Back to top" /></a>
        <h3><a name="B"></a><a name="Blackout"></a>Blackout</h3>
        <p>A blackout is a period of time during which an action does not take place. Blackouts can be applied to scheduled tasks in the <a href="../Scheduler/Blackouts.htm">MSS</a> and to notification recipients in the <a href="../Notifications/Configuring Blackouts.htm">GNS</a>.</p>

        <h3>BLOB</h3>
        <p>Binary Large Object. For more information see <a href="../BLOB Storage Service/BLOB Storage Service.htm">BLOB Storage Service</a>.</p>
        <h3><a name="BSS"></a>BLOB Storage Service (BSS)</h3>
        <p>The BLOB Storage Service (BSS) is a CygNet service that stores files. Any type of file can be stored in a BSS, including .app, .bmp, .csf, .dll, .doc, .exe, .ico, .ini, .jpg, .ocx, .rpt, .rsp, .rsq, .xls, etc. The term BSS is used generically to describe any BLOB Storage Service (APPS, BSS, custom).</p>
        <p>The CygNet services installation program sets up the host with two BLOB Storage Services: APPS and BSS. These services are the same type; they just have different names. The APPS is the repository for all of the CygNet client application files. The BSS is installed with no files and is intended as the repository for user files such as CygNet Studio screens, trends, etc. The reason that two BSS’s are created is to allow for differentiation of security and to separate CygNet applications from user data. <span class="CygNetVariablesSoftwareName">CygNet Software</span> recommends that users have read-only authorization to the APPS.</p>
        <p>Only three items differentiate the APPS and the BSS:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">The service folder. Each service has its own folder in the <b>CygNet\Services</b> folder.</li>
            <li value="2">The service name. The name is defined in the service .cfg file using the keyword SERVICE. Regardless of the service name, the names of the startup files are Bss.exe, Bss.cfg, and Bss.ddl. </li>
            <li value="3">The contents at initial startup. APPS is preloaded with CygNet client application files.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Communication State</h3>
        <p>CygNet includes a communications statistic for monitoring the communications state, or comm state. This statistic reflects the state of the most recent communications with the device. </p>
        <p>For more information see <a href="../Tables/UIS System UDCs.htm#SYCSSTTN">SYCSSTTN</a>, <a href="../Tables/UIS System UDCs.htm#SYCSSTAT">SYCSSTAT</a>, and <a href="../Universal Interface Service/Failed Comm Transition Period.htm">Failed Comm Transition Period</a>.</p>
        <h3>Communication Statistics</h3>
        <p>Communication statistics are calculated by the Universal Interface Service (UIS) and can be viewed in table form using the CygNet UIS View Control in CygNet Explorer or CygNet Studio. You can also create points for the statistics so that you can define alarms and notifications, as well as to report the values to the historian or to display them on CygNet Studio screens. Communication statistics can be monitored for both communication and remote devices. They are calculated from the last UIS restart, and most of the statistic types have options for current day (CD), current hour (CH), current month (CM), last day (LD), last hour (LH), and last month (LM) statistics. It is important to note that the statistics do not persist; that is, they are reset when the UIS is restarted. There is also an option to calculate rolling 20-minute window (2M) statistics; however, this feature must be enabled for the UIS. </p>

        <h3><a name="DBS"></a>Database Service or DBS-Based Service</h3>
        <p>A DBS-based service is a generic name for a service that stores information used by other services. DBS-based services include the Audit Service (AUD), Device Definition Service (DDS), Facility Service (FAC), Group Service (GRP), Master Scheduling Service (MSS), Note Service (NOTE), Point Service (PNT),and Table Reference Service (TRS).</p>
        <p>Other services that fall into this category structurally are the Access Control Service (ACS), BLOB Storage Services (APPS and BSS), Event Logging Services (ELS and ELSALM), and General Notification Service (GNS), although operationally they are considered administrative (ACS, APPS, BSS) and real-time services (ELS, ELSALM, GNS).</p>
        <p>All DBS-based services use the same database engine, and have very similar configuration parameters and security administration. Each type of DBS has a unique database schema. This is defined in the Data Dictionary Language (.ddl) file. You can view the contents of the file but do not edit it. The .ddl file also defines the indexes for the service. The indexes are useful for searching the database.</p>
        <p>The Value History Service (VHS) uses the same underlying data storage technology (ESE) as the other DBS-based services, but it is not considered a DBS-based service due to its unique archiving functionality.</p>

        <h3><a name="Dynagraph"></a>Dynagraph Cards</h3>
        <p>A Dynagraph Card provides information about rod-pump well performance.  Each card displays one complete stroke in a load versus position graph. Dynagraph cards are also called "DynaCards". Different types of cards can be polled from a device, though not all devices support all card types. </p>
        <p> Several EIEs have a <b>DynaCard</b> (or <b>Dynagraph Card</b>) data group for retrieving rod pump data. Several CygNet device template files contain DynaCard-related elements and attributes for defining data retrieval from a DynaCard-enabled device. </p>
        <p> The <a href="../CygNet Dynagraph Viewer/CygNet Dynagraph Viewer.htm">CygNet Dynagraph Viewer</a> can be used to view dynagraph cards. The <a href="../Scripting/CxDynagraph.htm">CxDynagraph</a> API provides an alternative method of interacting with the CygNet Dynagraph Viewer. The <b>DynaCard Library</b> is a collection of cards collected by a field device and stored by a VHS card storage service. </p>

        <p>The General Notification Service (GNS) stores and processes notification messages. Notifications are triggered by the setting and clearing of alarm bits. Notifications are enabled on a per alarm basis in the Point Service (PNT). When a current value service retrieves a value for a tag, it checks the tag record for alarm and notification settings. If the report notifications option is enabled, it sends the tag’s real-time record to the GNS for processing along with the GNS identifier. The GNS builds and processes the notification. The notification message and its recipients are stored in the GNS. The GNS supports several types of notification messages including email, text message, voice message (via a Dialogic board or SIP server), and others.</p>

        <h3><a name="GRP"></a>Group Service (GRP)</h3>
        <p>The Group Service (GRP) is a database service that stores group hierarchies based on facility and device attributes. Hierarchies are made up of nodes, each of which has its own set of properties and attributes. The GRP can store numerous hierarchies and their respective nodes, all of which are available  to the various CygNet services they interact with, like the Point Service (PNT) and Facility Service (FAC).</p>
        <p>Although the GRP powers group hierarchy creation and storage, the GRP is largely a behind-the-scenes service. Hierarchies stored in the GRP are typically created and edited using the <a href="../Groups/Group Hierarchy Manager Utility.htm">Group Manager</a> utility. Its interface is friendlier than the GRP editor and it enables both high- and low-level interaction with group hierarchies (and the GRP).</p>
        <div class="Note">
            <p><span class="NoteHeading">Important:</span> Although hierarchies can be edited within the GRP service using GRP editors, this is <u>strongly</u> discouraged. Instead, use the Group Manager utility to create and edit group hierarchies. See <a href="../Groups/Group Hierarchy Manager Utility.htm">Group Manager Utility</a> for more information.</p>
        </div>
        <p>In a CygNet SCADA context, a group is a collection of <a href="../Facilities/Facilities.htm">facilities</a> organized into hierarchies. Facilities are included in hierarchies according to user-selected <a href="../Facilities/Facility Attributes.htm">facility attributes</a> and device attributes. Attributes can be defined in a way that makes sense in your organization. Specific attributes can then be chosen to identify levels in user-defined hierarchies. Hierarchies enable the collection and organization of information specific to the facilities and devices to which those attributes belong.</p>

        <h3>HyperPoint</h3>
        <p>A HyperPoint is a discrete value calculated from current point values in other Universal Interface Services. It is a real-time point whose value and state are determined by the execution of an associated HyperPoint script. </p>
        <p>For more information see <a href="../Scripting/HyperPoint Scripting.htm">HyperPoint Scripting</a>.</p>
        <h3><a name="HSS"></a>HyperPoint Scripting Service (HSS)</h3>
        <p>The HyperPoint Scripting Service (HSS) is a CygNet real-time service that executes custom scripting to calculate user-defined HyperPoints based on time-specified events or a change in the point value. Although the service configuration is similar to that of the Universal Interface Service (UIS), the HSS does not collect data from external devices. You can use the CygNet Explorer client application to edit the HyperPoint scripts and view the point values.</p>
        <p>HyperPoints are configured as any other point by using the script editor built into the Point Service (PNT). When the HyperPoint script is configured on the <a href="../Points/PNT Editor - HyperPoint Page.htm">HyperPoint</a> property page in the PNT editor, you can compose, edit, and run a test simulation of the script. The HyperPoint script text is stored in the PNT database. </p>
        <p>It is recommended that you host HyperPoints using the HSS rather than a UIS. This action will eliminate performance impacts on real-time data acquisition. The maximum point count for the HSS is 500,000 points.</p>

        <h3><a name="Ordinal"></a>Ordinal</h3>
        <p>Ordinal is a generic term for an identifier. In an analog output data group, the ordinal would represent a point number or channel number. The name of an ordinal is manufacturer, device, and data group specific.</p>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="../EIEs - Remote Devices/Data Groups - Ordinals and Facility Ordinals.htm">Data Group Ordinals and Facility Ordinals</a>.</p>
        <h3>Ordinalized Data</h3>
        <p>If a point has more than one value at exactly the same timestamp, CygNet stores the extra value only if it is different. For example, if a value is set to 1.01 @ 12:32:15.004, 1.02 @ 12:32:15.004, and 1.03 @ 12:32:15.004, the VHS will store all three values even though the timestamps are exactly the same. CygNet assigns each entry an ordinal to allow a differentiation between the three entries. The datastore would reflect the following:</p>

        <p>The VHS datastore only evaluates the last (i.e. largest) ordinal to determine whether to set a new value. If another value of 1.03 @ 12:32:15.004 is set, CygNet will <i>not</i> store this as a new entry with an ordinal of 3, as it is detected as a duplicate. However, if a new value of 1.01 @ 12:32:15.004 is set, the VHS datastore will identify this as a new value (and not a duplicate) since it only compares the value to the largest ordinal, which is the 1.03 value at ordinal 2.</p>

        <p>Point state is the highest precedented state for a point record as defined in the <a href="../Points/Understanding the CvsMetadata File.htm">CvsMetadata</a> file for each CygNet point scheme. Every point state definition available for a point scheme has the following attributes: ID, name, description, display order, token, associated state colors (single color, foreground color, background color), and an alarm condition.</p>
        <p>The point state for a point record is based on 48 System, Configuration, and User <a href="../Points/Point Status Bits.htm">status bits</a>, which are associated with the four point types (Analog, Digital, String, Enumeration). A point record may contain up to 48 status bits, which are used to provide point status information about the point record in a Current Value Service (CVS) and the Alarm Event Logging Service (ELSALM).  A point can be in multiple states at the same time, for example, in <i>High Warning</i> and <i>High Alarm</i>; however, the state defined to be the most severe is the one that is used for the point state (i.e., <i>High Alarm</i>, in this case).</p>

        <h3><a name="Property"></a>Property vs. Attribute</h3>
        <p>While the terms "property" and "attribute" are synonyms in general use, in CygNet these terms convey a more nuanced meaning.</p>
        <p>A property refers to the aspects of a particular thing (facility, group node, point, etc.) with a <i>predefined</i> and <i>shared</i> meaning (for example, name, description, category, color, etc.), while attribute refers to the aspects of said thing with a <i>configurable</i> meaning. All facilities have a name and category; those are properties of a facility. Facility Attribute 1 can be configured to mean Order in Type or Route or Tank ID; it is an attribute.</p>
        <h3><a name="Pump"></a>Pump-Off Control (POC)</h3>
        <p>Pump-Off Control (POC) uses dynagraph cards to view well performance. CygNet provides an application for accessing  and viewing these cards.</p>

        <h3><a name="Redundan"></a>Redundancy</h3>
        <p>CygNet Redundancy achieves continuous operation of all CygNet services in the wake of component failure in the system, whether failure is due to normal operational transition of data from one location to another (via replication to move data from a primary server to a DR server, or backup, or forwarding, etc.), or due to an unforeseen natural disaster.</p>
        <p>Each site in a CygNet environment runs on  a unique domain and each domain is assigned a specific role: Active, Local Standby, or Data-Center Standby. When a failover is triggered (either <i>manually</i> via human intervention or <i>automatically</i> triggered without warning), all sites will swap domains, and assume a different role. Clients will always connect to the same domain, regardless of where the domain is running, and not have to make any changes as the result of a failover. CygNet redundancy operates on top of the CygNet replication model and is supported by underlying replication functionality, although replication is disabled for all services in a redundant environment. </p>
        <p>For more information see <a href="../Redundancy/Redundancy.htm">CygNet Redundancy</a>.</p>
        <h3><a name="Relative_Facilities"></a>Reference Facilities and Relative Facilities</h3>
        <p>CygNet supports the ability to resolve and/or display information about a facility that is different from the facility of the configured point for an object. For any given facility you can define a path to another facility within your CygNet environment  based on an attribute and a definition.</p>
        <p>Known as <b>Reference Facilities</b> and <b>Relative Facilities</b>, these concepts are similar, but the implementation and configuration of each differs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Reference Facilities</b> — <b>Reference Facilities</b> can only be configured for CygNet-aware tools in CygNet Studio via the <b>[ReferenceFacility]</b> property. Referenced facilities  only support a <i>single</i> level of resolution. They can be configured to resolve to a facility that matches a Source Attribute or a Facility Filter Rule.</li>
            <li value="2"><b>Relative Facilities</b> — <b>Relative Facilities</b> represent a more sophisticated method of referencing related facilities because it allows for <i>multi-level</i> resolution of facilities. This type of facility resolution is configurable (or scripted) from different locations within CygNet.</li>
