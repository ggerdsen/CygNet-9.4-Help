        <h2>Card Requests</h2>
        <p>The Dynagraph Viewer provides a simple interface for executing card requests. All requests are actually poll messages sent to the device, configured as DDS data groups. All card types are requested the same way; different types do not require different procedures (see below). However, if the device does not support a card type, the request commands for that type will be disabled. See <a href="Card Types.htm">Card Types</a> for card type descriptions and respective toolbar icons.</p>
        <p>The following card request procedures are described below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><a href="#Executin" class="selected">Executing card requests</a>
            </li>
            <li value="2"><a href="#Executin2" class="selected">Executing a card trace</a>
            </li>
            <li value="3"><a href="#Custom" class="selected">Executing custom card requests</a>
            </li>
            <li value="4"><a href="#Aborting" class="selected">Aborting card requests</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="Executin"></a>Executing Card Requests</h3>
        <p class="HeadingProcedure">To Request a Card</p>
        <p>Do one of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Click the relevant card request button on the toolbar (i.e. <img src="../../Resources/Images/CygNet Dynagraph Viewer/03000006.png" class="Inline" title="Current Card" alt="Current Card" /> for <b>Current Card</b>).</li>
            <li value="2">Select the relevant "Get" command from the <b>Poll</b> menu (i.e. <b>Get Current Card</b>).</li>
            <li value="3">Right-click in the Viewer window, point to <b>Get from Device</b> in the context menu, then click the card type. </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="Note">
            <p><span class="NoteHeading">Note:</span> If a new dialog box appears, the context-menu command is for multiple cards. See <a href="#Custom" class="selected">Custom Card Requests</a> below.</p>
        </div>
        <p>When the request is submitted, a dialog box appears to notify you of the action. Click <b>OK</b>. If the request fails, another dialog box will appear with the error description. The field to the right of the <b>Pending</b> box shows the card type currently being retrieved. If more than one card request is currently being processed, the count will be reflected in the status bar <b>Pending</b> box. A retrieved card is automatically added to the view set and its information is displayed in the card plot and details panel.</p>
        <h3><a name="Executin2"></a>Executing a Card Trace</h3>
        <p>The card trace option (<img src="../../Resources/Images/CygNet Dynagraph Viewer/0300000C.png" class="Inline" title="Card Trace" alt="Card Trace" />) lets you poll current cards at a specified interval for a specified duration, allowing you to closely monitor a well for a short length of time. As soon as the card trace is started, it will run for the user-specified duration then stop automatically. Traces can also be stopped manually. Each card is overlaid in the card plot as it is returned (see <a href="Card Viewing Options.htm#Overlayi">Overlaying Cards</a>). </p>
        <p class="HeadingProcedure">To Set up a Card Trace</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">On the <b>Poll</b> menu, click <b>Setup Trace</b>. The <b>Card Trace Setup</b> dialog box appears.</li>
            <li value="2">In the <b>Rate</b> field, enter the rate at which the device is polled in minutes and seconds (MM:SS). The default value is 30 seconds.</li>
            <li value="3">In the <b>Duration</b> field, enter the length of time of the card trace in minutes and seconds (MM:SS). The default value is two minutes.</li>
            <li value="4">Click <b>Save</b> to save these settings and return to the Viewer without starting a trace, or click <b>Start</b> to save settings and start a trace immediately.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Card trace settings are preserved across Dynagraph Viewer sessions. Whenever you start a trace, the current settings will be used. </p>
        <p class="HeadingProcedure">To Start or Stop a Card Trace</p>
        <p>Do one of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Click the <b>Start/Stop Card Trace</b> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/CygNet Dynagraph Viewer/0300000C.png" class="Inline" title="Card Trace" alt="Card Trace" /> on the toolbar.</li>
            <li value="2">On the <b>Poll</b> menu, click <b>Start Card Trace</b>.</li>
            <li value="3">Right-click in the Viewer, point to <b>Card Trace</b> on the context menu, then click <b>Start Trace</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As notification that a trace is running, the <b>Start/Stop Card Trace</b> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/CygNet Dynagraph Viewer/0300000C.png" class="Inline" title="Card Trace" alt="Card Trace" /> on the toolbar will depress, regardless what method was used for starting the trace. When a trace is stopped, automatically or manually, the button will return to normal. </p>
        <h3><a name="Custom"></a>Executing Custom Card Requests</h3>
        <p>It is possible to select more than one Current Card or Shutdown Card at once, or request multiple Shutdown/Pump-up card pairs. These commands are available on the <b>Poll</b> menu.</p>
        <p>Most devices cache a fixed number of current cards (usually 5). Using the Viewer you can request all of the cached cards, or a configured range. </p>
        <p>Different devices store cards in different orders. On some devices, cards are numbered in reverse chronological order. That is, "1" refers to the most recent card, and "5" refers to the card generated five strokes ago. Some devices use chronological order. CygNet returns cards in the order in which they are stored on the device.</p>
        <p class="HeadingProcedure">To Request Multiple Current Cards</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">On the <b>Poll</b> menu, click <b>Get Current Cards</b>. The <b>Request Current Cards</b> dialog box appears.</li>
            <li value="2">In the <b>First Card Number</b> field, enter the first card that you want to retrieve. This value is "1" by default, indicating that the poll will begin with most recent card. Entering "2" would give you the second card, and so on.</li>
            <li value="3">In the <b>Last Card Number</b> field, enter the number of the last card that you want to retrieve. This field is set to the device’s maximum current card retention number, so you cannot enter a number larger than the default.</li>
            <li value="4">Click <b>OK</b> to send the request.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The process of retrieving multiple shutdown cards is nearly identical to that of retrieving multiple current cards. The note (above) about card order still applies.</p>
        <p class="HeadingProcedure">To Request Multiple Shutdown Cards</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">On the <b>Poll</b> menu, click <b>Get Shutdown Cards</b>. The <b>Request Shutdown Cards</b> dialog box appears.</li>
            <li value="2">In the <b>First Card Number</b> field, enter the first shutdown card that you want to retrieve. This value is "1" by default, indicating that the poll will begin with the first shutdown card. Entering "2" would give you the second shutdown card, and so on.</li>
            <li value="3">In the <b>Last Card Number</b> field, enter the number of the last shutdown card that you want to retrieve. This field is set to the device’s maximum shutdown card retention number, so you cannot enter a number larger than the default.</li>
            <li value="4">For some devices, enter an integer value in the <b>Card Set</b> field to poll the cards from a specific shutdown card set. In most situations, leave this field as "1."</li>
            <li value="5">Click <b>OK</b> to send the request.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A variation of requesting multiple shutdown cards is requesting these cards with their subsequent pump-up cards. This process is similar to the above request procedures.</p>
        <p class="HeadingProcedure">To Request Multiple Card Pairs</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">On the <b>Poll</b> menu, click <b>Get Custom Card Pair</b>. The <b>Request Shutdown Card</b> dialog box appears.</li>
            <li value="2">In the <b>First Card Number</b> field, enter the number of the first shutdown/pump-up card pair that you want to retrieve. This value is "1" by default, indicating that the poll will begin with the first shutdown/pump-up card pair. Entering "2" would give you the second card pair, and so on.</li>
            <li value="3">In the <b>Last Card Number</b> field, enter the number of the last shutdown/pump-up card pair that you want to retrieve. This field is set to the device’s maximum card pair retention number, so you cannot enter a number larger than the default.</li>
            <li value="4">For some devices, enter an integer value in the <b>Card Set</b> field to poll the cards from a specific shutdown/pump-up card set. In most situations, leave this field as "1."</li>
            <li value="5">Click <b>OK</b> to send the request.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To send a card request with parameters and/or use a status point, use the <b>Execute Command</b> option in the <b>Device</b> menu.</p>
        <h3><a name="Aborting"></a>Aborting Card Requests</h3>
        <p>It is possible to abort all polls or just the current poll. Abort commands may be used if a request is taking a long time, if too many requests are queued up, or if you click the wrong button accidentally. </p>
        <p class="HeadingProcedure">To Abort the Current Request</p>
        <p>On the <b>Poll</b> menu, click <b>Abort Current Poll</b>. The request is aborted immediately with no further notification.</p>
        <p class="HeadingProcedure">To Abort all Pending Requests</p>
        <p>On the <b>Poll</b> menu, click <b>Abort All Polls</b>. All requests are aborted immediately with no further notification. The <b>Abort Current Poll</b> command is available only when a card request is being processed. The <b>Abort All Polls</b> command is available only when two or more requests are being processed. To see how many requests are pending, see the <b>Pending</b> field in the status bar.</p><a href="#top" class="selected"><img src="../../Resources/Images/Shared Images/Arrow_top.png" style="float: right;padding-top: 6px;padding-right: 2px;padding-bottom: 2px;" title="Back to top" alt="Back to top" /></a>
