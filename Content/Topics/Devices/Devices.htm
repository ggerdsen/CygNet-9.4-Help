        <h1>Devices</h1>
        <div class="Note">
            <p><span class="NoteHeading">Important:</span> Technical details about field devices (RTUs, PLCs, modems, routers, etc.) mentioned in this document are limited to only what is necessary to successfully use CygNet services to interoperate with them. It is assumed that you are familiar with your field devices. It is also assumed that you have access to field device technical documentation and/or support through the field device manufacturer.</p>
        </div>
        <p>There is a wide range of field device types available for deployment. Field devices vary greatly in the features provided, the communication protocols supported, the types of data produced, and the way they must be configured and maintained for reliable operation. Field devices often have extended communication requirements for features like security authorization and receipt of unsolicited cry-out messages. And added to these complexities is the need to simultaneously support many models and versions of field devices without further increasing the complexity or impacting the reliability of an entire SCADA implementation.</p>
        <p>That's where CygNet comes into the picture. CygNet does not produce remote terminal unit (RTU) nor programmable logic controller (PLC) devices, nor does it produce any of the numerous physical communication devices used in the field. Instead, CygNet develops (among other things) the software tools to allow these physical devices to interface with CygNet services. The primary tool CygNet has developed for interfacing with field devices is the Equipment Interface Engine (EIE). See <a href="Devices Overview.htm#Equipmen">Devices Overview</a> for more information.</p>
        <h3>Device Types</h3>
        <p>There are three basic Device types, and each uses their own type of CygNet EIE.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Remote Device EIEs:</b> Remote device EIEs enable the interface of CygNet services with field devices like RTUs and PLCs. They rely on communication EIEs to get and send data.</li>
            <li value="2"><b>Communication EIEs:</b> Communication  EIEs enable the interface of CygNet services with field communication devices. They also facilitate the use of remote devices since remote devices rely on communication EIEs to get and send data.</li>
            <li value="3"><b>Import/Export EIEs:</b> Import/Export EIEs are a special class of EIE. Strictly speaking, they do not interface with field devices. Instead, they interface with specialized applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other EIEs have been developed to solve special problems, such as acquiring properties from installed base or obsolete equipment that does not easily integrate with current information systems. Although these EIEs typically support only a limited feature set relative to our commercially available EIEs, they remain available to you upon inquiry.</p>
        <p>The <b>Devices</b> section and its associated topics provide information about relationships between field devices and CygNet equipment interface engines.</p>
