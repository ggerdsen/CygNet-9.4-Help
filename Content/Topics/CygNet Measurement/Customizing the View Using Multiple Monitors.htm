        <h2>Customizing the View Using Multiple Monitors</h2>
        <p>FMS Explorer screens can convey large quantities of measurement data, and several controls can be open simultaneously within your workspace. A screen can be customized to suit your purposes, but depending on the amount of information you prefer to view simultaneously, your data viewing needs may be better accommodated using multiple monitors. </p>
        <p>The following samples illustrate how customized each screen setup can be.</p>
        <p class="Example">Sample A</p>
        <p class="Indent">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/CygNet Measurement/Multiple_Monitors_Conglomerate_A_599x106.png" style="width: 599;height: 106;" />
        </p>
        <p class="Example">Sample B</p>
        <p class="Indent">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/CygNet Measurement/Controls_Interface_Multiple_Conglomerate_600x118.png" style="width: 600;height: 118;" />
        </p>
        <h3>Practical Usage</h3>
        <p>In actual usage, you will likely use a hybrid of arrangement styles to customize your workspace, depending on your particular data viewing needs. There are innumerable workspace layouts possible. </p>
        <p>When you use multiple monitors for viewing FMS Explorer, keep the following behaviors in mind. </p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Minimize</b> will minimize the whole application (including floating controls). </li>
            <li value="2"><b>Restore Down</b> will size down everything within the FMS Explorer window (but not any floating controls) to the most recent previously set screen size. </li>
            <li value="3"><b>Maximize</b> will maximize FMS Explorer to <i>one</i> monitor, even if it was previously stretched over multiple monitors.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Viewing FMS Explorer on Multiple Monitors</h3>
        <p>Use a combination of dragging, docking, resizing, and floating FMS Explorer controls to arrange a single monitor efficiently. The same options can be applied utilizing multiple monitors. As always, be sure to save your workspace before closing FMS Explorer. </p>
        <p>Some approaches to viewing your data on multiple monitors are described in the following examples.</p>
        <p>See <a href="Customizing the View.htm">Customizing the View</a> for more information about customizing options. </p>
        <p>See <a href="Using the File Menu.htm">Using the File Menu</a> for more information about saving your workspace.</p>
        <h4>Multiple Monitor Examples</h4>
        <div class="Note">
            <p><span class="NoteHeading">Note:</span> The following examples are meant to be illustrative rather than prescriptive. There are innumerable  variations possible for customizing the way you view data. Your implementation can be customized to suit your particular requirements.</p>
        </div>
        <h5>Example #1</h5>
        <p class="Indent">In this case, you may wish to spread the FMS workspace across three monitors, primarily using the <a href="Customizing the View.htm#Dragging">dragging</a> option to subdivide your workspace laterally. This approach supports accessing multiple controls per monitor sequentially, and using the control tabs to quickly switch between views. </p>
        <p class="Indent">Open FMS Explorer, and drag the screen to extend across your multiple monitors. Open all desired controls. Space the controls to support your work. You could group primary data overview functions, e.g. <b>Dashboard</b>, <b>Exceptions</b>, <b>Balance</b>, and <b>Node Chooser</b> controls,  on one screen, place primary work controls, e.g. <b>History Grids</b> and <b>Raw Data</b>, on a second screen, and support controls, e.g. <b>History Graphs</b>, <b>Config</b>, <b>Alarm</b>, and any other desired reference controls, on a third screen.  There are a myriad of possibilities.</p>
        <h6>Primary Monitor</h6>
        <p class="Indent">This monitor contains a <b>Node Chooser</b> control pinned to the left and a <b>Dashboard</b> control on the right, tabbed with <b>Exceptions</b> and <b>Balance</b> controls. With this arrangement you can maintain a large data viewing area to get a broad overview for recognizing patterns and prioritizing areas for further investigation. Once a Node of interest is identified, you can set it as the Session Node to drive any other controls that are linked to the Session Node, on any monitor, in order to further investigate and refine the data.</p>
        <p class="Indent">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/CygNet Measurement/Multiple_Monitors_Screen_No_1_602x325.png" style="width: 602;height: 325;" />
        </p>
        <h6>Secondary Monitor</h6>
        <p class="Indent">The next monitor contains tabbed <b>History Grid</b> and <b>Raw Data</b> controls for two sets of data.  With this arrangement you can  keep controls open for both a Session Node and another reference Node simultaneously, in order to drill down into the data, and quickly compare the data sets.</p>
        <p class="Indent">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/CygNet Measurement/Multiple_Monitors_Screen_2_601x324.png" style="width: 601;height: 324;" />
        </p>
        <h6>Tertiary Monitor</h6>
        <p class="Indent">A third monitor contains split panes, with all controls linked to the Session Node, to allow immediate presentation of related information. The first pane contains tabbed <b>History Graph</b> controls, allowing quick sequential access to different sets of process variables for analysis. The additional pane contains a <b>Config</b>, <b>Alarm</b>, and any other control desired, so that you can quickly refer to additional data.</p>
        <p class="Indent">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/CygNet Measurement/Multiple_Monitors_Screen_No_3_605x327.png" style="width: 605;height: 327;" />
        </p>
        <h5>Example #2</h5>
        <p class="Indent">In another case, you may wish to keep your FMS screen on one monitor, using primarily <a href="Customizing the View.htm#Docking">docking</a> options, and place additional controls on adjacent monitors, using primarily <a href="Customizing the View.htm#Floating">floating</a> options. This approach supports accessing multiple controls per monitor simultaneously, and uses docking and floating options to achieve desired divisions of both horizontal and vertical space within each screen. </p>
        <p class="Indent">Open FMS Explorer, and open all desired controls.  Your primary screen might house the FMS Explorer window along with a <b>Node Chooser</b>, and <b>Balance</b>, <b>Close</b>, and <b>PPA</b> admin controls. You could then float chosen primary controls on a secondary screen, e.g. <b>Dashboard</b>, <b>Exceptions</b>, <b>History Graph</b>, and <b>History Grid</b>, and  use a tertiary monitor  for viewing additional controls in support of your current work. There are endless variations possible.</p>
        <h6>Primary Monitor</h6>
        <p class="Indent">This monitor contains administrative and  reference data viewing functions. It houses a <b>Node Chooser</b> control on the upper left of the data window, tabbed with several other desired controls, so that you can quickly change the session Node, or access additional controls for reference. <b>PPA</b>, <b>Close Period</b>, and <b>Balance</b> controls have been docked individually, utilizing a horizontal format. In this way, you can view all selected admin controls simultaneously.</p>
        <p class="Indent">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/CygNet Measurement/Controls_Interface_Multiple_2.png" />
        </p>
        <h6>Secondary Monitor</h6>
        <p class="Indent">The next monitor contains <b>Dashboard</b>, <b>Exceptions</b>, <b>History Grid</b> and <b>History Graph</b> controls in a mixed horizontal/vertical split, achieved by floating the controls. In this way, you can tailor the screen space for each individual control as desired to view selected data ranges. Individual controls can be quickly dragged and enlarged for specific work and then placed back into position.</p>
        <p class="Indent">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/CygNet Measurement/Controls_Interface_Multiple_1.png" />
        </p>
        <h6>Tertiary Monitor</h6>
        <p class="Indent">A third monitor contains several controls arranged in subdivided horizontal layers. The first contains a <b>Close Period</b> and two <b>History Grid</b> controls, while the other panes each contain <b>History Graph</b> controls for different parameters. In this way, you can directly compare different views simultaneously.</p>
