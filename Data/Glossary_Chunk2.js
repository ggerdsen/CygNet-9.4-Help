define({'Universal Interface Service (UIS)':{d:'The Universal Interface Service (UIS) is the primary interface between field devices and CygNet devices. As the primary data collection service, the UIS is often called the \"workhorse\" of the CygNet system. It collects data for the devices stored in the Device Definition Service (DDS) and can store real-time records for up to 500,00 points for a 32-bit UIS and 5,000,000 points for a 64-bit UIS. Using CygNet Explorer, you can view current values for device points, as well as various device statistics for remote, communication, and import/export devices. The UIS works closely with the DDS and Master Scheduling Service (MSS), among other key services. Both a 32-bit UIS and a 64-bit UIS are available. The 32-bit UIS has a maximum point limit of 500,000 points. The 64-bit UIS has a maximum point limit of 5,000,000 points.

This is enforced by requiring administrator privileges to be assigned for the application(s), in order to perform certain administrative tasks. Refer to Microsoft online documentation at http://msdn.microsoft.com/for more information about UAC. For more information see CygNet and User Account Control.',l:''},'User Status Bits':{d:'User status bits are configured by a user to associate special status information about a point. There are 16 user status bits that can be associated with a point record. See Point Status Bits and User Status Bits for more information. Also see Configurable Status Bits and System Status Bits.',l:''},'Utilities':{d:'CygNet provides many stand-alone and command-line utilities to help manage your CygNet installation, including tools to help with the following tasks: installing software and updating hosts; host and license management; service diagnostics, monitoring, and management; database and file management; service configuration file management; communication device, remote device, and device template management; data group management; facility and group management; point configuration and management; data export; auditing and logging management; replication and redundancy management; and much more.

For more information see Notification Types.',l:''},'Value History Service (VHS)':{d:'The repository for historical data in CygNet Software is the Value History Service, also known as the CygNet Historian or the Enterprise Historian, or simply as the VHS. History reporting is configured on a per point basis. Reporting options are properties of the point configuration record. For more information see History and PNT Editor - History Page.',l:''},'VOIP':{d:'Voice over IP (VoIP) is a technology for the delivery of voice communications over Internet Protocol (IP) networks, such as the Internet. The CygNet General Notification Service (GNS) supports voice messaging for notifications via the SIP transport and media transfer protocols. For more information see SIP and Configuring VoIP Properties.',l:''},'Well Test':{d:'The CygNet Well Test Module is integrated with the CygNet SCADA system to track oil, water, and gas (OWG) values for wells in a production facility.
