The 64-bit version of Windows handles large amounts of random access memory more effectively than a 32-bit system. CygNet Software provides support for two 64-bit services (a 64-bit Universal Interface Service (UIS), and a 64-bit Value History Service (VHS)) and all remote device drivers, communication device drivers, and import export drivers are available in 64-bit versions, with the exception of the SonicMQ Export EIE and the SonicQ EIE, which are limited to 32-bit. Note that only the driver portion of each EIE is 64-bit; the associated editor is not 64-bit. For more information see Services Overview and 64-bit Device Drivers.',l:''},'Access Control Service (ACS)':{d:'The Access Control Service (ACS) is the CygNet Software security administration service. Its database contains the list of applications and events for which security is required, as well as the list of users and their authorization levels. In terms of security each service is an application. Security can also be applied at the record level in a service. The ACS can provide security for custom applications provided they can communicate with the ACS. It functions in concert with the operating system security (Microsoft Windows) to protect access to your system.\nFor more information see Security.',l:''},'Address Resolution Service (ARS)':{d:'The Address Resolution Service (ARS) is the CygNet Software directory service that resolves network addresses. It is sometimes called a metadata service since it resolves information about other CygNet services. The ARS must be running in order to install CygNet Software successfully. It tracks the network address and operational status of each service within a CygNet domain.\nA service must be added to the ARS before it is started for the first time. This eliminates superfluous entries and enforces administrator security. You can view and modify ARS records using CygNet Explorer.\nFor more information see Address Resolution.',l:''},'Admin.sec':{d:'Security Supervisors File. For more information see Security Supervisors.',l:''},'AGA':{d:'American Gas Association. Refer to the AGA website for more information.',l:''},'Alarm Condition':{d:'Alarm condition is the same as point state, in that it is the highest precedented state for a point record as defined in the CvsMetadata file for the current point scheme, except that in the point state definition for each point state, the alarm condition attribute must be set to \"true\" for the alarm condition to be considered. When alarm condition is set to true, the defined point state is considered a valid alarm condition.\nFor a system running the default CygNet Standard Point Scheme (Point Scheme 0), point state and alarm condition closely follow each other. For example, when a point is in a High Alarm condition, the point state and alarm condition will both be High Alarm. \nFor the standard CygNet point scheme, three point state definitions do not allow alarm condition configuration: the Normal, Unreliable, and Uninitialized point states. For these three point state definitions, the alarm condition attribute is always “false,” meaning that these point states will never be considered an alarm condition. So when a point is in a Normal, Unreliable, or Uninitialized state, the alarm condition will be blank. \nFor all other point state definitions, alarm condition is the highest precedented point state when alarm condition is set to true.  \nIn the CygNet Enhanced Point Scheme or other customized point schemes (Point Scheme 1 - 15), the alarm condition and other desired attributes (description, display order, associated state colors, etc.) can be configured in the CvsMetadata file as needed. See Understanding the CVS Metadata File for more information about configuring point scheme properties.',l:''},'Alarm Event Logging Service (ELSALM)':{d:'The Alarm Event Logging Service (ELSALM) is an instance of an ELS. Its purpose is to store alarm and notification events. It can be used to help you occasionally clear out the ELS without losing alarm history.\nFor more information see Logging.',l:''},'AP':{d:'Alphanumeric Page (associated with the GNS). For more information see Notification Types.',l:''},'API':{d:'Application Programming Interface. See also CygNet API below. For more information see Scripting.',l:''},'Application Administrator':{d:'A person who can add, delete, and modify users and user permission levels contained in an Access Control Service (ACS). See also Access Control Service (ACS).\nFor more information see Configuring Application Administrators.',l:''},'Application Storage Service (APPS)':{d:'The Application Storage Service (APPS) is an instance of a BLOB Storage Service (BSS). CygNet uses this service to store client application files.\nFor more information see BLOB Storage Service.',l:''},'Applications':{d:'For security-related purposes, CygNet services are considered applications. The application name is user-defined in each service’s configuration file, with the exception of the Address Resolution Service, which is named “ARS.”\nFor more information see Applications.',l:''},'Archive Files':{d:'Archive files are associated with the Value History Service, which can be configured to store value entries to separate compressed archive files. All values for all points are logged to a single compressed archive file for each day. Entries are written to the compressed archive at the same time they are written to the main history file, and may be retained for a specified time interval.\nFor more information see History.',l:''},'Attribute':{d:'See Property vs. Attribute.',l:''},'Audit Service (AUD)':{d:'The Audit Service (AUD) tracks and stores all changes, such as what was changed, when it was changed, and the individual who made the change, known as the audit record. It logs operator actions and configuration changes, as defined for various services. The level of detail contained in an audit record is based on the service’s auditing configuration. The Audit Service does not audit itself.\nAuditable actions include starting or stopping a service through the RSM, updating or deleting values in the VHS, setpoint changes, point configuration changes, etc.\nFor more information see Auditing.',l:''},'Automatic Backups':{d:'Automatic full backups are user defined to a relative or absolute directory path, based on defined keyword parameters set in the applicable CygNet services’ configuration files. \nFor more information see Backup and Restore.',l:''},'Automatic Service Recovery':{d:'The RSM is expected to restart (or fix) any failed local service. This is accomplished via the Automatic Service Recovery feature of CygNet, configured for each service in the RSM. Whenever a service shuts down abnormally the RSM will attempt to restart the service via the recovery actions configured in the RSM. Automatic service recovery can be mass configured for all services in a Redundancy environment via the Automatic Service Recovery option in the Redundancy Editor.',l:''},'Blackout':{d:'A blackout is a period of time during which an action does not take place. Blackouts can be applied to scheduled tasks in the MSS and to notification recipients in the GNS.',l:''},'BLOB':{d:'Binary Large Object. For more information see BLOB Storage Service.',l:''},'BLOB Storage Service (BSS)':{d:'The BLOB Storage Service (BSS) is a CygNet service that stores files. Any type of file can be stored in a BSS, including .app, .bmp, .csf, .dll, .doc, .exe, .ico, .ini, .jpg, .ocx, .rpt, .rsp, .rsq, .xls, etc. The term BSS is used generically to describe any BLOB Storage Service (APPS, BSS, custom).\nThe CygNet services installation program sets up the host with two BLOB Storage Services: APPS and BSS. These services are the same type; they just have different names. The APPS is the repository for all of the CygNet client application files. The BSS is installed with no files and is intended as the repository for user files such as CygNet Studio screens, trends, etc. The reason that two BSS’s are created is to allow for differentiation of security and to separate CygNet applications from user data. CygNet Software recommends that users have read-only authorization to the APPS.\nOnly three items differentiate the APPS and the BSS:\n- The service folder. Each service has its own folder in the CygNet\\Services folder. \n- The service name. The name is defined in the service .cfg file using the keyword SERVICE. Regardless of the service name, the names of the startup files are Bss.exe, Bss.cfg, and Bss.ddl. \n- The contents at initial startup. APPS is preloaded with CygNet client application files. \n For more information see BLOB Storage Service.',l:''},'BTU':{d:'British Thermal Unit.

The ELSALM stores alarm history.',l:''},'Communication Device':{d:'Communication or comm devices are the communication interfaces between a host server and remote devices.',l:''},'Communication State':{d:'CygNet includes a communications statistic for monitoring the communications state, or comm state. This statistic reflects the state of the most recent communications with the device.',l:''},'Communication Statistics':{d:'Communication statistics are calculated by the Universal Interface Service (UIS) and can be viewed in table form using the CygNet UIS View Control in CygNet Explorer or CygNet Studio. You can also create points for the statistics so that you can define alarms and notifications, as well as to report the values to the historian or to display them on CygNet Studio screens. Communication statistics can be monitored for both communication and remote devices. They are calculated from the last UIS restart, and most of the statistic types have options for current day (CD), current hour (CH), current month (CM), last day (LD), last hour (LH), and last month (LM) statistics. It is important to note that the statistics do not persist; that is, they are reset when the UIS is restarted. There is also an option to calculate rolling 20-minute window (2M) statistics; however, this feature must be enabled for the UIS.',l:''},'Configurable Status Bits':{d:'Configurable status bits are used to facilitate CVS alarm functions and calculations, as well as CAS and GNS reporting.
