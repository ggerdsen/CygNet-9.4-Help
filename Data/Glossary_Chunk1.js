define({'Group Service (GRP)':{d:'The Group Service (GRP) is a database service that stores group hierarchies based on facility and device attributes. Hierarchies are made up of nodes, each of which has its own set of properties and attributes. The GRP can store numerous hierarchies and their respective nodes, all of which are available to the various CygNet services they interact with, like the Point Service (PNT) and Facility Service (FAC).\n\nAlthough the GRP powers group hierarchy creation and storage, the GRP is largely a behind-the-scenes service. Hierarchies stored in the GRP are typically created and edited using the Group Manager utility. Its interface is friendlier than the GRP editor and it enables both high- and low-level interaction with group hierarchies (and the GRP).\n\nImportant: Although hierarchies can be edited within the GRP service using GRP editors, this is strongly discouraged. Instead, use the Group Manager utility to create and edit group hierarchies. See Group Manager Utility for more information.\n\nIn a CygNet SCADA context, a group is a collection of facilities organized into hierarchies. Facilities are included in hierarchies according to user-selected facility attributes and device attributes. Attributes can be defined in a way that makes sense in your organization. Specific attributes can then be chosen to identify levels in user-defined hierarchies. Hierarchies enable the collection and organization of information specific to the facilities and devices to which those attributes belong.\n\nFor more information see Groups.',l:''},'HMI':{d:'Human-Machine Interface.

You can use the CygNet Explorer client application to edit the HyperPoint scripts and view the point values. HyperPoints are configured as any other point by using the script editor built into the Point Service (PNT). When the HyperPoint script is configured on the HyperPoint property page in the PNT editor, you can compose, edit, and run a test simulation of the script. The HyperPoint script text is stored in the PNT database. It is recommended that you host HyperPoints using the HSS rather than a UIS.

CygNet assigns each entry an ordinal to allow a differentiation between the three entries. The VHS datastore only evaluates the last (i.e. largest) ordinal to determine whether to set a new value. If another value of 1.03 @ 12:32:15.004 is set, CygNet will not store this as a new entry with an ordinal of 3, as it is detected as a duplicate. However, if a new value of 1.01 @ 12:32:15.004 is set, the VHS datastore will identify this as a new value (and not a duplicate) since it only compares the value to the largest ordinal, which is the 1.03 value at ordinal 2.',l:''},'Ordinalized Data Group or Data Group Ordinal':{d:'You can ordinalize a data group if a remote device requires multiple instances of a data group.

Each site in a CygNet environment runs on a unique domain and each domain is assigned a specific role: Active, Local Standby, or Data-Center Standby. When a failover is triggered (either manually via human intervention or automatically triggered without warning), all sites will swap domains, and assume a different role. Clients will always connect to the same domain, regardless of where the domain is running, and not have to make any changes as the result of a failover.

Known as Reference Facilities and Relative Facilities, these concepts are similar, but the implementation and configuration of each differs. Reference Facilities — Reference Facilities can only be configured for CygNet-aware tools in CygNet Studio via the [ReferenceFacility] property. Referenced facilities only support a single level of resolution. They can be configured to resolve to a facility that matches a Source Attribute or a Facility Filter Rule.
